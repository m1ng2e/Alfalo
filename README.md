# Alfalo
Alfalo is an **A**ny**L**ogic Library for **Fa**st **L**ay**o**ut Generation. It provides a easy way to generate complex layout programmatically in AnyLogic Models. 

There are two main features: `Station/Center Manipulation` and `Fast Path Generation`.

**Station/Center Manipulation**:

We first define stations to be rectangular nodes in AnyLogic, and centers to be groups of stations arranged in a certain way. Manipulation of stations and centers means apply rotation and mirroring on stations and centers. In most of the complex layouts, there are stations and centers that are the same but are just manipulated in some way. The Alfalo library enables the users to define prototypes for stations and centers , so that new stations and centers can be easily generated by specifying the position and the manipulation of the corresponding prototype, as shown in Figure 1 and 2.

**Fast Path Generation**:

Rather than defining paths one by one, like how it is normally done in AnyLogic, the Alfalo library enables easy paths generation by requiring the users to define less (Alfalo) paths. When an Alfalo path is defined to cross one or more rectangular nodes, multiple paths connecting the rectangular nodes will be automatically generated, as shown in Figure 3. When two Alfalo paths are defined to cross each other, four paths connected by a point node will be automatically generated, as shown in Figure 4.
