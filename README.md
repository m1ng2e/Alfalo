# Alfalo
Alfalo is an **A**ny**L**ogic Library for **Fa**st **L**ay**o**ut Generation. It provides a easy way to generate complex layout programmatically in AnyLogic Models. 

There are two main features: `Station/Center Manipulation` and `Auto Path Generation`.

**Station/Center Manipulation**:
In most of the complex layouts, there are stations and centers that are the same but are just manipulated (rotated or mirrored) in some way. The Alfalo library enables the users to define prototypes for stations and centers (i.e. group of stations arranged in a specific way), so that new stations and centers can be easily generated by specifying the position and the manipulation of the corresponding prototype. This feature may be especially useful with generating supply chain and manufacturing layouts, as in those seetings, there are usually stations and centers with the same configuration but just manipulated differently.
